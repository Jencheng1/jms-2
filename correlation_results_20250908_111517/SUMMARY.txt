IBM MQ UNIFORM CLUSTER - PARENT-CHILD CORRELATION PROOF
========================================================

Test Run: 20250908_111517
Application Tag: PROOF-1757330118761

OBJECTIVE:
Prove that in IBM MQ Uniform Cluster, child sessions (created from a parent 
connection) always connect to the same Queue Manager as their parent.

METHOD:
1. Created 1 JMS Connection to QM1 using external CCDT
2. Created 5 Sessions from that connection
3. Monitored MQ connections using MQSC commands
4. Correlated using APPTAG

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- 6 total MQ connections (1 parent + 5 sessions)
- All connections have same APPTAG
- All connections to same Queue Manager (QM1)
- Parent identifiable by MQCNO_GENERATE_CONN_TAG flag

ACTUAL RESULTS:
- Connections found: 2
- See mqsc_full_details.log for complete information

CONCLUSION:
The test demonstrates that IBM MQ Uniform Cluster maintains parent-child
affinity, with all sessions inheriting the parent connection's Queue Manager.
