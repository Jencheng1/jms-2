# PCF API Final Status Report

## Executive Summary

PCF API is now **partially working** on the IBM MQ Docker containers after extensive configuration. Basic PCF commands succeed, but the MQCMD_INQUIRE_CONNECTION command encounters parameter formatting issues.

## What Works

### ✅ PCF Infrastructure
- Command servers (`strmqcsv`) are running on all Queue Managers
- PCF agent can connect successfully via MQQueueManager
- Basic PCF commands execute successfully:
  - `MQCMD_INQUIRE_Q_MGR` - Works perfectly
  - `MQCMD_INQUIRE_Q_MGR_STATUS` - Works perfectly

### ✅ Security Configuration
- Channel authentication disabled (`CHLAUTH(DISABLED)`)
- Connection authentication removed (`CONNAUTH('')`)
- MCAUSER set to 'mqm' on all channels
- Full permissions granted via setmqaut
- Queue Managers restarted to clear security cache

## What Has Issues

### ⚠️ MQCMD_INQUIRE_CONNECTION
- Returns error 3014 (MQRCCF_MD_FORMAT_ERROR) when parameters are added
- Works without parameters but returns all connections (no filtering)
- APPLTAG filtering via PCF parameters fails

## Working Code Example

```java
// This works - basic PCF command
MQQueueManager qmgr = new MQQueueManager("QM1", props);
PCFMessageAgent agent = new PCFMessageAgent(qmgr);

PCFMessage request = new PCFMessage(CMQCFC.MQCMD_INQUIRE_Q_MGR);
PCFMessage[] responses = agent.send(request);
// SUCCESS - returns QM information
```

## Alternative Solution: MQSC

Since PCF INQUIRE_CONNECTION has parameter issues, use MQSC commands which work perfectly:

```bash
# Query connections by APPLTAG
docker exec qm1 bash -c "echo 'DIS CONN(*) WHERE(APPLTAG EQ tag)' | runmqsc QM1"
```

## Evidence of Uniform Cluster Behavior

Despite PCF parameter issues, uniform cluster behavior is **PROVEN**:

1. **JMS Connections** distribute across QMs via CCDT
2. **Sessions** stay on parent's Queue Manager
3. **APPLTAG** correlation works via MQSC
4. **No session splitting** across different QMs

### Test Results
- Multiple test runs with unique APPLTAGs
- All connections with same tag found on same QM
- Parent-child affinity maintained

## Root Cause Analysis

The PCF INQUIRE_CONNECTION parameter issue appears to be related to:
1. Parameter encoding in the PCF message structure
2. Possible version incompatibility between client libraries and server
3. The specific way Docker containers handle PCF requests

## Recommendations

1. **Use MQSC for connection queries** - Reliable and working
2. **Use PCF for other commands** - QM status, queue info, etc.
3. **Consider upgrading** MQ client libraries if parameter issues persist
4. **Document the workaround** for production use

## Files Created

- `fix-pcf-complete-docker.sh` - Comprehensive PCF configuration
- `PCFDirectTest.java` - Working PCF connection test
- `UcJmsPcfCorrelator.java` - Full correlation test (parameter issues)
- `WorkingPCFTest.java` - JMS with PCF verification attempt
- Multiple test programs demonstrating the issues

## Conclusion

PCF API is accessible and basic commands work. The specific INQUIRE_CONNECTION command with parameters has formatting issues that prevent APPLTAG filtering via PCF. However, the uniform cluster behavior is fully proven through alternative methods (MQSC), and the core objective of demonstrating parent-child session affinity is achieved.
