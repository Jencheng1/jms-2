Creating connection...

=== PHASE 1: INITIAL CONNECTION ===
Now check which QM has the connection:
Run this command to find the connection:

for qm in qm1 qm2 qm3; do
  echo "Checking $qm:"
  docker exec $qm bash -c "echo 'DIS CONN(*) WHERE(APPLTAG EQ VERIFY-1757453241913)' | runmqsc ${qm^^}" 2>/dev/null | grep -c AMQ8276I | xargs -I {} echo "  Found {} connections"
done


=== PHASE 2: STOP THE QM ===
⚠️  STOP THE QUEUE MANAGER that has the connection!
   Example: docker stop qm1 (or qm2 or qm3)

Waiting for failover to occur...
